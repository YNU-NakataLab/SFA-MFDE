# SFA/MFDE

-This is an open source code of SFA/MFDE implemented by MATLAB.

-You can easily use this code on Evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform ([PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO)) on MATLAB.

## How to run

  1. Download [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases) from here.

  2. Add SFA/MFDE source code to "Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization".

  3. Run "platemo.m" and select SFA/MFDE on GUI.

  4. Determine the experimental settings and push "Start" button.
